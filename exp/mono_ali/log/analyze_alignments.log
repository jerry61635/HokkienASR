At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,34.4,84) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (42,44.6,69) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (29,34.5,78) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 100.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 84.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 100.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 3.4 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 100.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (28,33.7,78)
