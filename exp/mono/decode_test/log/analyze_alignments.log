At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,33.1,75) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (44,46.2,71) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,33.4,74) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 100.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 83.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 100.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.3 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 100.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (26,32.4,74)
