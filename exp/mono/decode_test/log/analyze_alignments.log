At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 97.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,18.6,47) frames.
At utterance begin, nonsilence accounts for 2.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,22.8,39) frames.
At utterance begin, sim accounts for 2.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,20.8,22) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 96.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (35,35.4,60) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 3.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (29,50.9,171) frames.
At utterance end, in accounts for 2.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,26.2,43) frames.
At utterance end, ê accounts for 1.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (39,39.2,43) frames.
At utterance end, o̍h accounts for 0.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (152,160.3,172) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 72.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,27.2,55) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 27.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,24.9,48) frames.
Overall, ê accounts for 9.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,28.8,47) frames.
Overall, ē accounts for 7.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,16.4,27) frames.
Overall, o̍h accounts for 4.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (33,38.5,74) frames.
Overall, in accounts for 3.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,17.9,33) frames.
Overall, sim accounts for 2.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,20.3,43) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 74.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 88.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 71.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 1.3 hours of data, or 0.3 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 69.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (24,27.2,55)
