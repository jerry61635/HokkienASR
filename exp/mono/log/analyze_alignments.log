At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 99.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,24.4,75) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 99.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (39,46.1,79) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 95.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,33.9,79) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 4.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,25.8,47) frames.
Overall, ê accounts for 3.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,26.9,48) frames.
Overall, ē accounts for 0.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (18,18.2,31) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 96.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 85.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 95.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 3.3 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 94.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (27,33.7,79)
