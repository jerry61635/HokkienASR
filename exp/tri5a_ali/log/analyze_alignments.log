At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 99.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,32.4,81) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 99.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (40,42.8,72) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 95.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (29,34.9,79) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 4.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,26.1,53) frames.
Overall, ê accounts for 3.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,27.3,56) frames.
Overall, ē accounts for 0.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,21.4,34) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 96.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 85.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 95.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 3.4 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 94.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (28,34.5,79)
