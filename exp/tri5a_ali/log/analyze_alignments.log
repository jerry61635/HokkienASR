The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 20.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 89.4% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 19.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 2.2 hours of data, or 1.7 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 13.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (19,23.3,57)
