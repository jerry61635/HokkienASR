The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 21.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 89.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 19.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 2.2 hours of data, or 1.7 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 13.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (20,23.6,58)
