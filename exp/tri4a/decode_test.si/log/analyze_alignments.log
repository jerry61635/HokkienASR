The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 21.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 91.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 19.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.5 hours of data, or 0.4 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 12.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (20,24.5,59)
