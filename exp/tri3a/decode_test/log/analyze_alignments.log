The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 22.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 92.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 20.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.5 hours of data, or 0.4 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 12.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (21,25.1,59)
