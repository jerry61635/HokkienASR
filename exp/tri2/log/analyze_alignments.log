At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 99.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,30.8,79) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 99.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (40,45.3,73) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 95.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,34.0,78) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 4.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (22,23.2,44) frames.
Overall, ê accounts for 3.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,24.3,45) frames.
Overall, ē accounts for 0.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,18.5,32) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 96.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 84.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 96.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 3.4 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 94.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (27,33.3,78)
